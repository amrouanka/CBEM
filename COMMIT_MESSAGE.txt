feat: Add comprehensive search optimizations with LMR and Delta Pruning

- Enhanced LMR logic with dynamic reduction based on move count and depth
- Added Delta Pruning in quiescence search to skip unpromising captures
- Optimized move scoring with O(1) piece detection replacing O(n) loops
- Improved move sorting with efficient insertion sort for small move lists
- Enhanced PV table management using Array.Copy for better cache performance
- Added check detection caching to avoid redundant king position calculations
- Implemented safety checks to prevent negative depth recursion
- Added piece value lookup for capture evaluation in pruning

Performance improvements:
- Reduced computational complexity in critical search paths
- Better cache locality and memory access patterns
- Enhanced pruning to reduce search tree size
- Improved move ordering for earlier alpha-beta cutoffs
- Optimized data structures for faster access

This represents the culmination of chess engine optimization work
with significant performance improvements while maintaining accuracy.
