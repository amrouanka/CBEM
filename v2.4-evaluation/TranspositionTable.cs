    - If score >= beta: we CUTOFF and return beta

    - If score <= alpha: the move was bad, we didn't improve
      The REAL score might be even lower! So it's an UPPER bound.
      
    - If alpha < score < beta: we found the exact score!

        Why Mate Scores Need Special Treatment? Here's an example:
        Depth 5 search: Found checkmate in 3 moves
        Stored score: +49000 - 3 = +48997  ← relative to ROOT

        Later, depth 3 search at ply=2:
        Retrieved score: +48997
        But now we're at ply 2, so "mate in 3" 
        from root = "mate in 1" from here!
        Correct score should be: +49000 - 1 = +48999

        FIX:
        When STORING: add ply    (convert from relative to absolute)
        When READING: subtract ply (convert from absolute to relative)
